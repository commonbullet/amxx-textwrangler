# Amxmodx - TextWrangler

## Warning
This project has some missing parts under development, compiling tools are working though.


### Summary
This projects focus on providing tools in order to help compiling and writing AMX Mod X plugins on TextWrangler.


## Compiling Scripts

### Features

* Compiling scripts are written in AppleScript, allowing them to be called directly from TextWrangler menu.
* It takes advantage of the new Half-Life structure so it can check which mod has an amxmodx installation.
* If there's more than one mod with amxmodx, you might choose in which to compile from a list.
* Compiling output is straightforward, it goes to amxmodx/plugins.
* It does a fairly decent job on terminal tabs, creating new ones for new compilations and using the existing ones in case they are already there.

### Installation
1. Download the files from TextWrangler folder
2. Find the <code>TextWrangler/Scripts/AmxModx</code> directory
3. Open the <code>Scripts</code> folder inside <code>&lt;user home>/Library/ApplicationSupport/TextWrangler</code> installation. The easiest way to do that is to run TextWrangler, go to menu Scripts (that one with an icon ) >"Open Scripts Folder".
4. Drop the <code>AmxModx</code> folder from download inside <code>Scripts</code> you just opened.
